# This is an example how to define an integer

a = 10 # Creating a variable 'a' and assigning an integer value of 10 to it

b = 20 # Creating a variable 'b' and assigning an integer value of 20 to it

c = -30 # Creating a variable 'c' and assigning an integer value of -30 to it

d = 1000000214554879632564846841384641848

# To print the value of the declared variable 'a'
print("The value of 'a' is: ", a)

# To check the data type of the assigned data to variable 'a'
print("The type of 'a' is: ", type(a))

# To print the value of the declared variable 'b'
print("The value of 'b' is: ", b)

# To check the data type of the assigned data to variable 'b'
print("The type of 'b' is: ", type(b))

# To print the value of the declared variable 'c'
print("The value of 'c' is: ", c)

# To check the data type of the assigned data to variable 'c'
print("The type of 'c' is: ", type(c))

# To print the value of the declared variable 'd'
print("The value of 'd' is: ", d)

# To check the data type of the assigned data to variable 'd'
print("The type of 'd' is: ", type(d))
